            <p>The biggest lesson we learnt during this project was that of research. It is key to have good research of your target audience. If your research is not representative of your target audience, then you may miss certain key concerns or constraints it has. We realized even if the problem is well understood or designs are well made, if the user and their requirements are not understood then most likely the app will not fully satisfy them.</p>
